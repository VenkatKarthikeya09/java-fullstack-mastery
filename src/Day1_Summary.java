                *** Day 1 Learning Summary ***
                1. JDK (Java Development Kit): This is the toolbox for developers. It includes the compiler (javac) to turn our .java files into .class files.
                2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment): This is what's needed to RUN a Java program. It contains the JVM.
                3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The 'magic' that runs our compiled Java code. It allows our code to be "Write Once, Run Anywhere."
                4. IDE (IntelliJ IDEA): Our smart editor that helps us write, run, and debug code efficiently.
                5. Git: Our Version Control System. It's like a time machine for our code, tracking every change.
                6. Core Git Commands: I learned 'git status', 'git add', 'git commit', and 'git push'.""");
